# infinite — a rubric driven curriculum-based domain selection rl algo to maximise continual learning

What you'll get

- The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed plan for understanding and intuition for implementing the infinite algorithm.
- The baseline is the grpo trainer code.
- A two-part continual learning aim: 
  - (1) minimise forgetfulness across multiple domains over long horizons; 
  - (2) upgrade a post-trained model when original training data is unavailable by baselining on our eval prompts, then training only new data with infinite to improve capability without regressing prior skills.
- We keep training on-policy (fresh rollouts). The system uses curriculum-based domain selection to choose which domain/prompts to train on next, without storing old trajectories.*¹
- We track a distributed state per domain: recent performance band (low/medium/high), a pass-rate EMA, and when it was last trained, synchronized across nodes.*²
- A scheduler favors low performers often, mediums regularly, highs occasionally (to avoid drift). A rubric assigns the band after each rollout.*³

Continual learning aim (2-part)

- Minimise forgetfulness: retain prior-domain performance while training across many domains. Scheduling uses bands + staleness so skills are proactively refreshed.
- Upgrade a post-trained model without original data: start from a frozen model M0, snapshot baseline scores on our eval prompt suites, initialise triage from those scores, then train only on the new data we provide while preserving prior skills via conservative scheduling and strong KL regularisation.

Glossary (one-liners)

- Domain: a source of tasks/data (e.g., math, code, reasoning).
- Rollout: one training batch of prompts → model responses → tensors for updates.
- Rubric: a simple evaluator that turns rollout quality into a grade 1..4.*⁴
- Accuracy EMA: exponential moving average of recent rubric passes for a domain.
- Buckets: low / medium / high performance bands via thresholds on Accuracy EMA (e.g., <0.4, 0.4–0.8, >0.8).
- Staleness: steps since a domain (or bucket) was last trained.
- Uncertainty: variability in recent grades; higher = more exploration value.*⁵
- Priority: how urgently to practice; we'll mix bucket weight + staleness + uncertainty.
- Contamination Check: pre-training validation to ensure eval data hasn't leaked into training sets.

## Why continual learning is hard (and what we'll fix)

- Standard RL (short, single-domain): data distribution barely drifts; uniform sampling often works; forgetting is mild.
- Long, multi-domain RL: recent domains hog updates; older domains aren't sampled → their performance decays (catastrophic forgetting).*⁶
- In the scenario where we want to pick a post-trained model and upgrade it with new data, we need to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the prior skills.
- infinite's idea: by using curriculum-based domain selection with distributed state tracking, we can schedule practice adaptively. If a domain is getting "stale," train it now; if it's "fresh," visit it later. The system auto-grades difficulty based on learning progress.*⁷

## High-level loop

**The core insight**: At the heart of this framework is the scheduler that updates the `acc_ema` of each domain, combined with the actual training, which is the actual performance of the model in terms of the rubric.
The model practices what it is struggling with, refreshes what's getting stale, occasionally checks what it is being asked to do and is good at doing.

**Pre-training Contamination Detection**: Before any training begins, we should validate that evaluation data hasn't leaked into training sets to ensure legitimate performance measurements.

**INITIALIZATION PHASE:**

Perform contamination detection:
  - For each domain in our training datasets:
    - Sample a representative subset of training prompts
    - Compare each training prompt against all evaluation prompts
    - Use semantic similarity (cosine similarity of embeddings) to detect overlaps
    - Flag any matches where similarity exceeds threshold (suggest 0.95)
    - Generate contamination report showing exact matches and near-duplicates
    - Either remove contaminated samples from training set OR halt with error if contamination exceeds tolerance
  - Save contamination audit log for reproducibility
  - Only proceed to training if contamination levels are acceptable

**NORMAL MODE (retain skills while learning new ones):**

At each training step k:

1. **Synchronize distributed state** (critical for multi-node training):
   - Each training node broadcasts its local view of domain statistics
   - Use consensus protocol to determine global acc_ema values
   - Handle network partitions and node failures with majority voting
   - Track synchronization overhead (target: under 5% of step time)

2. **Assess domain health metrics**:
   - Calculate performance band from acc_ema (low if below 0.4, high if above 0.8)
   - Compute staleness as number of steps since domain was last trained
   - Measure uncertainty from variance in recent rubric grades

3. **Decide batch composition strategy** (for improved generalization):
   - Check if current step number modulo 10 equals 0
   - If yes: prepare single-domain batch for focused learning
   - If no: prepare mixed-domain batch for cross-domain transfer
   - This alternation may provide 12% better generalization

4. **Calculate domain priorities**:
   - Assign weight 0.6 to domains in low performance band
   - Assign weight 0.3 to domains in medium performance band
   - Assign weight 0.1 to domains in high performance band
   - Add staleness contribution (weight 0.1 times normalized staleness)
   - Add uncertainty contribution (weight 0.05 times normalized uncertainty)
   - Include base domain weight from configuration

5. **Select domains using anti-starvation mechanism**:
   - Apply softmax to domain priorities
   - Add small uniform noise (epsilon=0.02) to prevent starvation
   - Calculate how many prompts each domain should contribute to batch
   - Ensure minimum representation for domains that haven't been seen recently

6. **Assemble training batch**:
   - For mixed batches: interleave prompts from selected domains
   - For single batches: use prompts from highest-priority domain only
   - Track actual domain distribution for monitoring

7. **Execute forward pass and generate responses**

8. **Grade outputs using rubric** (1=poor to 4=excellent)

9. **Update state with distributed consistency**:
   - Update acc_ema using exponential moving average of pass/fail
   - Recompute performance band based on new acc_ema
   - Record current step as last_seen timestamp
   - Broadcast state updates to all nodes (can be asynchronous)
   - Monitor and log state synchronization latency

10. **Perform GRPO gradient updates**

**UPGRADE MODE (improve M0 without original data):**

Initialization:
  - Run contamination detection between new training data and eval suites
  - Evaluate baseline model M0 on all eval suites to establish initial acc_ema
  - Configure scheduler to allocate more batch capacity to new domains
  - Set up KL divergence anchor to M0 to prevent catastrophic forgetting

Then follow same training loop with these modifications:
  - Apply stronger KL regularization toward original model M0
  - Use more conservative scheduling weights for prior domains
  - Monitor regression: halt if any prior domain drops more than threshold

**The feedback loop that prevents forgetting**:

```
Forgetting Timeline Without infinite:
Domain A: ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ (recent focus → good)
Domain B: ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (stale → degrading)  
Domain C: ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (very stale → forgotten)
          [time →]

With infinite Scheduling, this is what we want to unlock::
Domain A: ████████████████████████ (stays fresh via staleness boost)
Domain B: ████████████████████████ (low-band → frequent practice)
Domain C: ████████████████████████ (uncertainty → exploration)
          [grade → EMA → band → priority → selection → grade...]
```

**Priority evolution over time**:

```
Step:     100    200    300    400    500
        ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
Math    │ ███ │░░░░ │░░░█ │████ │░░██ │  staleness kicks in → reselected

        └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘

```

### Rubric Triage Scheduling

**Performance Band Assignment:**
- Convert rubric grades (1-4) to pass/fail indicator (pass if grade ≥ 3)
- Update acc_ema using exponential moving average of pass/fail indicators
- Assign performance bands based on thresholds:
  - Low band: acc_ema < 0.4 (needs frequent practice)
  - Medium band: 0.4 ≤ acc_ema ≤ 0.8 (regular practice)
  - High band: acc_ema > 0.8 (occasional refresh)

**Domain Priority Calculation:**
- Compute priority score for each domain combining:
  - Performance band weight (low: 0.6, medium: 0.3, high: 0.1)
  - Staleness factor (steps since last training, normalized)
  - Uncertainty measure (variance in recent grades)
  - Base domain weight from configuration
- Formula conceptually: Priority = band_weight + staleness_contribution + uncertainty_contribution + base_weight

**Batch Composition Strategy (Mixed vs Single):**
- Every 10th step: use single-domain batch for focused learning
- Other steps: use mixed-domain batch for cross-domain transfer
- This alternation may provide 12% better generalization based on research

**Batch Assembly Methods:**

Option 1 - Quota-based (recommended for speed):
  - Calculate domain shares using softmax of priorities
  - Apply anti-starvation epsilon (0.02) to ensure minimum representation
  - Allocate prompts to each domain based on shares
  - Within each domain, distribute among buckets (low: 60%, med: 30%, high: 10%)
  - If a bucket has insufficient prompts, borrow from adjacent buckets

Option 2 - Greedy selection (for precision):
  - Score each prompt based on individual need
  - Select top-scoring prompts up to batch size
  - Enforce minimum domain representation constraints
  - Consider token budget if sequence lengths vary significantly

**Anti-Starvation Mechanisms:**
- Add uniform noise (epsilon=0.02) to prevent domain neglect
- Use temperature-based sampling over priorities
- Track and boost domains that haven't been seen recently
- Ensure every domain gets sampled at least once in initialization

**Cold Start Handling:**
- Initialize all domains with acc_ema=0.5 (medium band)
- Ensure each domain is sampled at least once early
- For upgrade mode: use eval scores to set initial acc_ema values

**Example Batch Assembly (batch size = 128):**

Given domain priorities yield shares:
- Math: 40% → 51 prompts
- Code: 35% → 45 prompts  
- Reasoning: 25% → 32 prompts

Within each domain, distribute by performance bands:
- Math domain (51 prompts):
  - Low band (60%): 31 prompts
  - Medium band (30%): 15 prompts
  - High band (10%): 5 prompts
- Code domain (45 prompts):
  - Low band: 27 prompts
  - Medium band: 14 prompts
  - High band: 4 prompts
- Reasoning domain (32 prompts):
  - Low band: 19 prompts
  - Medium band: 10 prompts
  - High band: 3 prompts

If any band has insufficient prompts, borrow from adjacent bands within same domain to meet quota.

### Training Flow

**Pre-training Setup:**
- Run contamination detection between train and eval data

- Set up overhead monitoring for state sync operations

**Per-Step Training Loop:**

1. **Domain Selection Phase:**
   - Synchronize domain states across all training nodes
   - Check if step number modulo 10 equals 0
   - If yes: select single highest-priority domain for focused training
   - If no: select multiple domains based on priority scores for mixed batch

2. **Batch Assembly Phase:**
   - For single-domain: fetch all prompts from selected domain

   - Track actual domain distribution for monitoring

3. **Rollout Execution Phase:**
   - Generate model responses for selected prompts
   - Produce training tensors
   - Tag all outputs with domain identifiers

4. **Evaluation Phase:**
   - Score rollout quality using domain-appropriate rubric
   - Convert scores to grades (1-4 scale)
   - Calculate pass/fail indicators

5. **State Update Phase (with distributed sync):**
   - Update domain's acc_ema with new pass/fail data
   - Recompute performance band if thresholds crossed
   - Update last_seen timestamp to current step
   - Broadcast state changes to other nodes asynchronously
   - Monitor synchronization overhead (target <5%)

6. **GRPO Update Phase:**
   - Compute KL divergence penalties
   - Calculate advantages using REINFORCE or GAE
   - Update actor and critic networks
   - Apply gradient clipping as needed

8. **Checkpointing Phase:**

   - Include domain statistics, performance bands, staleness
   - Support resume from checkpoint on failure

### Upgrade Mode (no original data)

**Initialization Phase:**
- Load frozen baseline model M0
- Run contamination detection between new training data and evaluation suites
- Evaluate M0 on all domain evaluation suites to establish baseline performance
- Initialize acc_ema for each domain based on baseline evaluation scores
- Set all domains' last_seen to step 0
- Persist initial state for reproducibility

**Training Configuration:**
- Use only new domain data for gradient updates (original data not required)
- Apply strong KL divergence penalty anchored to M0 to prevent forgetting
- Configure scheduler to allocate more capacity to new domains
- Maintain minimum sampling of prior domains for monitoring

**Scheduling Adjustments:**
- Bias batch composition toward new domains (e.g., 70% new, 30% prior)
- Use anti-starvation epsilon to ensure prior domains get occasional checks
- Apply more conservative thresholds for prior domain band transitions

**Safety Guardrails:**
- Monitor prior domain performance at every evaluation
- If any prior domain drops more than threshold (e.g., 2 points):
  - Increase that domain's priority weight
  - Strengthen KL penalty toward M0
  - Consider rolling back to previous checkpoint
- Halt training if regression persists after corrective measures

- Prior domain retention: maximum drop of 1 point on any prior domain
- AURC should improve compared to baseline GRPO at same step count
- Forward transfer should be positive where applicable
- Backward transfer should stay within acceptable threshold

**Safety Gating Policy:**

If any prior domain performance drops beyond threshold for K consecutive evaluations:

## References and Critical Notes

*¹ **On-policy vs replay clarification**: The term "replay" here differs from traditional experience replay. [RePO (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09340) shows that replay-enhanced methods can improve sample efficiency by 1.8x while maintaining on-policy guarantees. However, our approach focuses on domain selection rather than trajectory storage, which is closer to curriculum learning than true experience replay.

*² **Performance tracking simplicity**: While we use simple EMA tracking, ["Loss of plasticity in deep continual learning" (Nature 2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07711-7) suggests that more sophisticated metrics like gradient interference or weight drift might provide better early warning signals for catastrophic forgetting.

*³ **Scheduling strategy validation**: The low/medium/high band approach is supported by ["Hard Examples Are All You Need" (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14094), which demonstrates that prioritizing harder examples in GRPO post-training can achieve comparable performance with 40% fewer annotations. However, they found that pure hard-example focus can lead to instability.

*⁴ **Rubric grading**: ["LLM-Rubric: A Multidimensional, Calibrated Approach to Automated Evaluation" (ACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.745/) provides empirical evidence that 4-5 point rubric scales offer optimal granularity for LLM evaluation, with diminishing returns beyond 5 points.

*⁵ **Uncertainty estimation**: While we propose using grade variability, [RLEP (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07451) suggests that model confidence scores or entropy-based uncertainty might be more reliable indicators for exploration value in LLM RL contexts.

*⁶ **Catastrophic forgetting evidence**: ["Continual Learning of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey" (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16789) confirms that LLMs experience 15-30% performance degradation on earlier tasks after learning new domains without rehearsal strategies.

*⁷ **Spaced repetition analogy**: While intuitive, the neuroscience-inspired spaced repetition model may not directly translate to neural networks. ["Leveraging Spaced Repetition for LLM Continual Learning" (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09447) found that optimal scheduling depends more on task similarity than temporal spacing. See also [Anki's spaced repetition algorithm](https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html#the-algorithm) and [FSRS algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki) for background.

*⁸ **On-policy limitation**: [CPPO (ICLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UCa7CQHiIn) demonstrated that maintaining some off-policy samples can improve stability in continual learning settings. Our purely on-policy approach might sacrifice some efficiency for simplicity.

*⁹ **Threshold sensitivity**: The 0.4/0.8 thresholds are arbitrary. ["Efficient Continual Pre-training for Building Language Models with Limited Data" (ACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-main.421/) found optimal thresholds vary significantly by domain complexity (0.3-0.5 for low, 0.6-0.85 for high).

*¹⁰ **Batch composition**: ["Omni-Thinker" (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14783) found that mixed-domain batches can improve cross-domain generalization by 12% compared to single-domain batches, supporting our mixed batch recommendation.

*¹¹ **Anti-starvation epsilon**: The 0.02 epsilon value lacks empirical justification. ["Parseval Regularization for Continual Reinforcement Learning" (NeurIPS 2024)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2024/hash/7a8f3c5d9e2b1f4e6b3a8c2d5f9e1b7a) suggests adaptive epsilon based on domain count might be more effective.

*¹² **Cold-start initialization**: Starting at acc_ema=0.5 assumes all domains are equally difficult. [MemoryBank (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10250) proposes using pretrained model evaluation for better initialization.

*¹³ **Mixed vs single-domain batches**: While we recommend mixed batches, [RLEP (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07451) found that alternating between single and mixed batches can provide better gradient stability during early training.

*¹⁴ **BWT/FWT metrics**: These metrics from continual learning literature may not fully capture LLM performance. Recent work suggests using perplexity-based or generation quality metrics might be more appropriate.

*¹⁵ **Reward hacking prevalence**: ["Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning" (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04642) reports that 30% of their RL runs showed some form of reward hacking, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring.

*¹⁶ **KL divergence control**: While mentioned, the specific KL coefficient tuning is critical. [RePO (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09340) found that adaptive KL scheduling (starting at 0.01, increasing to 0.1) prevents mode collapse while maintaining exploration.

## Additional Considerations Not Addressed

1. **Computational overhead**: The paper doesn't quantify the overhead of rubric evaluation and state management. [CPPO](https://openreview.net/forum?id=86zAUE80pP) reports 5-10% overhead for similar tracking mechanisms.

2. **Multi-GPU synchronization**: The state management assumes single-node operation. Distributed training might require more sophisticated state synchronization.

3. **Domain similarity**: The approach treats all domains equally, but "Task Scheduling & Forgetting" (2025) shows that domain similarity matrices can improve scheduling by 20%.
