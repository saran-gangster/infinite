a rubric driven prioritized replay rl algo to maximise continual learning

this project implements a novel reinforcement learning approach that leverages prioritized replay mechanisms guided by learning rubrics to optimize continual learning performance. the algorithm focuses on:

- **rubric-driven prioritization**: using structured evaluation criteria to determine experience replay priority
- **continual learning optimization**: maximizing knowledge retention and transfer across learning tasks
- **adaptive replay strategies**: dynamically adjusting replay priorities based on learning progress and performance metrics

this is a fully open source work. for a comprehensive explanation of the theoretical foundationsand to see how it grows see - [https://tokenbender.com/post.html?id=infinite-a-rubric-driven-prioritized-replay-to-maximise-continual-learning](https://tokenbender.com/post.html?id=infinite-a-rubric-driven-prioritized-replay-to-maximise-continual-learning)
